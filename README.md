# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of the data set that you are analyzing. Include the link of where you obtained the data.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software to analyze the data.}
This was my first time try to analysis data. I really enjoyed learning how to do so and solving the different problems that came my way. I found it intresting the insigts
the data provided. I analysied a dataset provided by Kaggle.com. It contains comprehensive statistics from NBA players from 1950 to 2017. Ultimately I wanted to learn some
basics of data analysis and see how much I enjoyed it.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Data Analysis Results

Question 1: What are the career averages of NBA players across different statistics?
Answer: The career averages per season per game across different statistics are visualized in a line chart.

Question 2: Who are the top players with the highest average per game stats?
Answer: Wilt Chamberlain, Michael Jordan, Elgin Baylor, Kevin Durant, LeBron James

Question 3: Who are the top defensive players based on certain defensive statistics?
Answer: Alvin Robertson, Micheal Ray, Michael Jordan, Mookie Blaylock, Chris Paul

Question 4: Who are the top offensive players based on certain offensive statistics?
Answer: Wilt Chamberlain, Michael Jordan, Elgin Baylor, Kevin Durant, LeBron James

# Development Environment

I developed this project using pyton. The libraries used: Pandas for data analysis, matplotlib for data visulization

# Future Work

- Improve the charts and data returned using matplotlib.pyplot
- My analysis techniques were not perfect, In the future I would like to incorporate a weighted system for specific values
- The user interface here wasn't great either. Creating this a mobile app would help.
